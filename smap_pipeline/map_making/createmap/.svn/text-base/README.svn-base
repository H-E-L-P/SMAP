To add a new parameter to the config file system, it has to appear in 
the following places:

1. in the info structure definition at the top of createmap_read_conf.pro
2. in the CASE statement further down in that function
3. in the tests for value set in create_itermap_from_conf.pro
4. in the call to CREATE_ITERMAP further down in that function
5. in the parameter list to CREATE_ITERMAP, as well as whatever effect
   the parameter will have there
6. add description to conffiles/template.conf

If you are storing data in pointers, you will have to add the destruct 
function to CREATEMAP_FREE_CONF in createmap_read_conf.pro.
